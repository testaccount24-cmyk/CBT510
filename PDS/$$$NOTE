Sam;

The SPACE program is another utility that I had developed and
which is helpful to search volumes by volume names, storage group
names, unit address and mount status.  The list that the SPACE
program shows is a search result, and a specific volume can be
selected to view a list of data sets inside, and space used in
VSAM data sets too.

The IEBLIST program don't use SORT yet.  I'm planning to do it
soon by adding a keyword to do this and call the SORT program.

Best regards;
